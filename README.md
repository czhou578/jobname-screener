# Jobname Screener Extension

Assuming that you have a Google spreadsheet with a column that lists the names of the companies that you have applied for, this Google Chrome extension tracks and highlights those corresponding names on job websites (in orange), ensuring that you don't apply to 
the same jobs twice. It currently works with the YCombinator jobs website, LinkedIn, and Indeed.
